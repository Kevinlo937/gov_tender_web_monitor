# Web Scraper Analysis Report

## Summary of Findings

After extensive testing and analysis of the web scraper for the Taiwan Public Construction Commission website (https://web.pcc.gov.tw/pis/), I've identified several issues with the search functionality. Despite multiple attempts with various parameter combinations, the scraper is unable to retrieve tender announcements.

## Analysis Process

1. **Initial Parameter Analysis**
   - Examined the original search parameters in `web_scraper.py`
   - Tested with broader search criteria (removing project keyword, extending date range to 6 months)
   - No results were found with the original parameters

2. **Website Structure Analysis**
   - Directly navigated to the website to examine the actual search form
   - Identified discrepancies between the form on the website and the parameters used in the scraper
   - Noted that the website form uses different field names and structure than our implementation

3. **Parameter Modifications**
   - Updated form data parameters to match the website:
     - Changed `tenderStatus` to `tenderType`
     - Changed `tenderDateRadio` to `dateRadio`
     - Added `proctrgCate: tenderBasic` parameter
     - Improved headers with Origin and Referer fields
   - Created a new script `updated_web_scraper.py` with these modifications

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test 1: Original keywords '交通局' and '水湳' with updated form parameters
   - Test 2: Using only organization keyword '交通局'
   - Test 3: Using broader organization keyword '台中'
   - Test 4: Empty keywords to get any results
   - All tests used a 12-month date range for maximum coverage

## Results

Despite all modifications and testing with various parameter combinations, no tender announcements were found. All requests returned HTTP status code 200 (success), but the response HTML did not contain any tender rows.

## Possible Explanations

1. **Website Protection Mechanisms**
   - The website may have CAPTCHA or other anti-scraping measures
   - Session-based authentication might be required
   - The website might detect and block automated requests

2. **Form Submission Requirements**
   - The website might require additional hidden fields or tokens that are generated dynamically
   - The search form might use JavaScript to submit, which our simple POST request doesn't replicate

3. **Data Availability**
   - There might genuinely be no tender announcements matching our criteria
   - The website structure might have changed significantly since the scraper was originally developed

## Recommendations

1. **Manual Verification**
   - Manually search the website with the same parameters to verify if results exist
   - Use browser developer tools to capture the exact request parameters when submitting the form manually

2. **Session-Based Approach**
   - Implement a session-based approach that first loads the main page, extracts any necessary tokens, and then submits the search
   - Consider using a browser automation tool like Selenium for a more authentic browsing experience

3. **Alternative Data Sources**
   - Investigate if the Taiwan Public Construction Commission provides an official API
   - Look for alternative sources of tender announcement data

4. **Simplified Monitoring Approach**
   - Consider monitoring specific pages or RSS feeds if available, rather than using the search functionality

## Next Steps

If you would like to proceed with improving the scraper, I recommend:

1. Manually verifying search results on the website
2. Implementing a session-based approach with requests or Selenium
3. Capturing and analyzing the network traffic during a manual search to replicate it exactly

Please let me know if you would like me to implement any of these recommendations or if you have additional information about how the website should be accessed.
